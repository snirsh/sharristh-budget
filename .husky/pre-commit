# Fast pre-commit: format + lint staged files, then typecheck all
# Total time: ~3-8 seconds (vs 30-60s before)

# Step 1: Format and lint staged files with Biome (instant)
pnpm exec lint-staged

# Step 2: Typecheck all packages with tsgo (fast, ~2-5s)
# tsgo is 5-10x faster than tsc, making full typecheck viable
pnpm exec turbo typecheck --ui=stream
